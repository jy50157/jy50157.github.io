			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p style="border:1px solid black">
				
				It was one part vision and two parts passion that brought founder and CEO, Jaeyoon Yi, to start pursuing her dream of owning a clothing boutique. Her vision was a boutique where everyone could afford own what they can express as themselves which meant high style with heart.  Her focused concept of fashion under $100 that carried both quality and ensuring prices started to attract many customers and made them feel great about their purchases and the services at our store. We will continue to bring the most of success to both our customers and the brand.
				<br>
				<br>
			At the core of the company, JOCS has one main mission – to help women realize their worth. We strive to make every woman to walk out of our store feeling much more confident than before! Our boutiques offer a vibrant mix of carefully-curated clothing, bright baubles, must have accessories, and playful/thoughtful gifts that are as fun to give as they are to receive. 
<br>
<br>
JOCS reveal an array of new arrivals almost every day, so you’ll always discover something special and delightful on every visit you make. And because we are a boutique, we only carry small amounts of each products, so everything you find will uniquely be yours! You will less likely see your outfit twin at anywhere!
